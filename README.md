The project started with designing the graphical user interface (GUI).  
Then, I implemented the core functions for countdown, score tracking (CPM/WPM), and sentence generation.  
After that, I added the typing logic with real-time validation of the user's input.  
Finally, I made small visual improvements like highlighting the current word in green.

The only thing I would still improve is the visual design of the interface.
